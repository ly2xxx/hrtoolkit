1. **CSV Format**: Replace the sample data generation with your CSV file:
   ```python
   # In succession_app.py, modify the load_sample_data function
   @st.cache_data
   def load_sample_data():
       return pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Required Columns**:
   - `employee_name`: Employee name
   - `employee_role`: Job title
   - `employee_level`: Organizational level
   - `years_experience`: Years of experience
   - `reviewer_type`: Type of reviewer (Manager, Peer, etc.)
   - Competency scores: `leadership_score`, `communication_score`, etc.
   - `strengths`: Text feedback on strengths
   - `development_areas`: Text feedback on development needs

### Modifying Competencies

Edit the competencies list in `succession_planning.py`:

```python
self.competencies = [
    "leadership", "strategic_thinking", "communication", 
    # Add your custom competencies here
]
```

### Customizing Succession Paths

Modify the succession paths in `succession_planning.py`:

```python
succession_paths = {
    "Your Target Role": ["Eligible Level 1", "Eligible Level 2"],
    # Add your organization's succession paths
}
```
